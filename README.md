# PlotSeismicity
Plot 3D views of the seismicity


## Step 1: select your region of interest (as well as the magnitude requirements).
Plot by obspy. Not sure why the coordinates went wrong.

## Set the views

Two parameters can be set:
* azm
* dep
Those parameters control the angles for projection.

## Step 2: run 

```python viewer.py```

In the example, the dep is fixed, and a loop over azimuth (0-360, every 5‚Å∞).
This produces 72 images.
Resolution for coastlines and final images can be adjusted.

Step 3: assemble all the 2D images into a gif (to be implemented)

@earthinversion , we count on you for some further implementations.
